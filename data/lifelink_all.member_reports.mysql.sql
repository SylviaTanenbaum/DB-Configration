After some minutes the earth emptied under their feet and absorded in the ruins. This happened in America, which we considered to be the oasis of peace… The main destructive thing is a person´s mind…….the history of mankind is constructing and destroying, some of them build, others destroy. When much negative energy is accumulated it leads to such situation….People repent their sins at churches, but ourside they break the ten commandements….At last I can think once about the only way out - that is love - love of men, love of life…. Diana Samakashvili Form XI : \"I like to talk politics because I beleive that we can change everything….I feel optimistic about the changes in the life in our country, though I understand that it´s very difficult problem….We must try to make our society more open, democratic and caring about people…….It´s necessary to keep peace on Earth. First of all, all countries must start universal disarmament….We can save the Earth, only if we put our efforts together….the Earth is our common home……I think that children can do a lot for peace. By getting to know each other children can aa help grown ups to bring down the barriers of fear and misunderstanding…….\", Khatuna Berishvili: \"Peace all Over the World. We can consider peace one of the wonders of the modern world, that we are still here, Becaucse we have bombs that could destroy the world but we have not used them.

This year our main efforts were focused to clean the bank of a river. This river crosses the city always in summer, causing a great damage because its waters carry a great amount of garbage and mud that pollute the beaches where many people specially tourist go to have a good time. When this happens people obviously leave this place and the efforts of the authorities of the city to make Arica a touristic city are in vain. We also wanted to increase the friendship among the members of the group. and this activity was an opportunity to develop a common work which would allow to share time experiences we also thought that the work done could be a way to know each one contributing to the development of our city and giving a real support to tourism, and to care for our environment.\r\nWe also choose the bank of SAN JOSE river because it is an irreplacable environmental place, so important to keep it in the best conditions. Unfortunately people who live along its borders do not care or do not know how important it is to maintain this place clean, not only for themselves but for all the habitants of our city ARICA. Fortunately many people specially public services and NGOs worry about this situation and decided to join efforts to recover this river, which we expect will be done the year we will celebrate the bicentenary .\r\nWORK DONE\r\n\r\nEach group gathered on the border of this river (Now there is not water), and we (teachers and students and other people ) received by a member of CONAMA (official office dedicated to preserve the environment) who gave us the instructions and materials needed to start working ( last week me and Vilma member of CONAMA had been preparing this meeting). Specific areas given to each school to talk with the neighbours explaining what we are doing, inviting them to maintain the bank and the border of the river clean and giving them a special bag with messages where to place the garbage.\r\nThe cleaning of the bank was the reponsability of the diffrentes students of diffrentes schools. We worked supported by workers and trucks of the town hall to retire the garbage gloves and masks were given to all of them. Near this place there is a small square that needs to be clean, be painted and also needs flowers and plants, this work was done by differents students and teachers of the schools and all material needed were provided\r\nThe next time I will send a photo.\r\nMy Best Wishes! /Gladys; Vilma;(CONAMA) Gabriela, Enrique and Ana( Teachers) and Adrian Garrido and all students from Arica Chile\r\n\r\n');

The Romanian Government established the headquarter of National Minorities Day in Tulcea, as an example of tolerance, understanding and harmony among people.\r\nAgricultural College ,,Nicolae Cornateanu”, participated with 20 students ( Greeks, Ukrainians, Turkish, Russians, Armenians, Italians, Germans, Jews) at the festivities. The students are members of Ethnographyc Club which activate in our school. We were invited at the Town Hall, together with all the ethnic communities. The action started with the Mayor speech that stressed the importance of this Day for the people of our town who live in peace for centuries, then he presented the honor guests who were the representatives of all ethnic groups in Parliament. The Mayor said that most of the people from Tulcea belonged to mixed families, and this is why we understand very well each other. I am an example of this harmony and understanding, because I am half Greek and half Ukrainian (one of my grand-grandmother was French) and my husband is Hungarian. In fact we all belong to the large Balkan area. My students presented Christmas folk songs (some of them celebrate Christmas on 6 January) and they explained the importance of this event for their community. Turkish girls spoke about Ramadan and danced a very old dance. All of the students wore traditional colorful clothes. The festivity went on with a short presentation of each community. At the end, we elaborated a manifesto (a sort of a letter) in which we explained that \"multiculturalism is a part of our life, even we go to different churches or we celebrate Christmas at different time. In our families parents and grandparents speak different languages and pray at different Gods, but they have the same moral values. Tolerance and peace is the answer for every kind of fight.\"\r\n\r\n',20,'15-18',2,30,'','','jpg','2003-01-09 00:00:00','2003-01-12 00:00:00','Local authorities: Mayor and other local representatives (leaders of 4 political groups)\r\nNational authorities: representatives of minorities in Parliament, representative of Romanian Govern\r\nParticipation of community : 12 ethnic groups and their members……250 people\r\nOrganisations: NGOs, Red Cross\r\nMass media: reporters at national and local newspapers and television.\r\n');

I´d like to tell you about how we spent the day of water in our school.\r\nWe had a contest in which all the students from the sixth to the tenth grades showed their knowledge about water and saving water resources. Sitting in the jury, I saw how the children reacted to this contest and to the whole day of water. I must say that I was very surprised that the children took the contest very seriously, especially the sixth grades. Some of them where even better than the tenth grades! This means that the future of the world will be in good hands!\r\nAs the UN declared the year 2002 the year of mountains, our next contest will be about mountains at which we will be teaching children all about mountains.\r\nI am confident that such contests are very cognizable for the children and are very good for our planet Earth!\r\n\r\nVladimer Ivanchenko\r\nPresident of UNESCO club in school 211\r\n\r\nCODE OF WATER RULES\r\n1. Close the valves while not using the water.\r\n2. Prefer the shower than taking a bath.\r\n3. Don´t just pour out unused water, it is better to water a plant in the garden.\r\n4. Do not use the water if you see a leak in the pipe.\r\n5. Water the lawns only before 10:00 A.m. and after 6:00 P.m.\r\n6. Don t waste the water while washing the car (better go to a car wash where less water is used).\r\n7. Do not litter near the water (lakes, rivers, etc.).\r\n8. If you live near a lake or a river, organize a party and name it \"Keep our water clean\" . This team of volunteers should clean the waterfront from garbage and so help the planet!\r\n9. If going on a cruise, never throw any garbage overboard.\r\n10. Tell your parents and friends about these rules and tell them how important it is to protect water.\r\n\r\nWater is one of the most important natural resources of our planet. People use water in different ways: we build hydro-electric power-stations, make sewage fields, we use water in different branches of industry and manufacturing. And the most important - we drink it.\r\nNo creacher can live without water - for example, a human can live without food for a week, but without water only four days.\r\nBut it s a pity that we can also pollute the water: we pollute it whith trash, junk, pesticides, waste from plants and factories. And we don´t just pollute it: the water strikes back! When the rivers are polluted so badly that the water can´t drain there begins a flood; While testing nucleur bombs tsunamy waves may appear. And this is only a short list of natural cataklisms that can appear if we don´t take care of the hydrosphere.\r\n\r\nBut hese are only words. If all the country leaders, the presidents in the whole world would hear them from all of us, from the children, from the next generation, I´m sure that there would be a difference, perhaps something will change! So hear my words and remember them:\r\n\r\nSAVE THE WORLD: DON´T POLLUTE THE WATER!\r\n\r\nBy Vladimer Ivanchenko 7-V\r\n',90,'',5,0,'','','NULL','2003-03-25 00:00:00','2003-03-28 00:00:00','');

We have seen your documentary film “Bowling for Columbine” recently in the context of our English course. We liked it a lot because we think that the theme is universal and hyper important. With your announcement at the Oscar and and Cesar ceremonies, we have seen that you are someone who really goes up to the end of his conviction, which we appreciate!\r\nAt school, with Mrs Flammang, our english teacher, we have been debating a lot about violence and for three weeks especially about the war in Irak. That’s why we would like to communicate with schools around the world to be more aware of other young people’s opinions about violence and war. In this context we think that it’s important to keep contact with young Americans as well, because we don’t want you to think that if we are against this war we are against America. We just want communication between us. \r\nThe idea started when we first thought of communicating with Iraki students.. Indeed, we got a contact from Hans Levander, responsible for www.life-link..org Do you know this site? If not, be curious and have a look. It is so nice as well. Hans and his team have been planning school contacts with Iraqi school as an “important healing process in the post-war rehabilition”.\r\nThen we all realised we had a lot to share with young people from everywhere, not only Iraqi students but also US students as we think this “super-power” must be more connected to the global “family”. \r\nWhat do you think of this project? Could you please help us find contacts with schools in your country. Seeing your involvement we bet you’ll like our project and will help us. We are really looking forward to a quick reply.

Students also worked to improve their understanding of what is involved in collecting, purifying and delivering drinking water to Bacau. They investigated what information was available locally on drinking water quality and how it was presented, and prepared a short guide. They were also interested in sources of pollution to ground and surface water and the origin and meaning of drinking water standards. The group divided up responsibilities: one group visited the Public Health Control Department in Bacau; other groups went to the General Hospital, and the Water Quality Control Institute. When they talked with analytical chemists and pediatricians, they discovered that Bacau County has the third highest nitrite intoxication in Moldavia.(Eastern part of the country). The group took 50 water samples from wells in 30 villages and identified six wells where nitrate levels were above acceptable levels. (Nitrate from fertilizers and human and animal waste is converted by bacteria into nitrite and it is this ion that causes health problems by complexing with hemoglobin in the blood.) The group distributed copies of their guide and marked the polluted wells with warning notices. They also presented their findings to local mayors and made presentations in local schools.

Based on the\r\nplan the school would be run by selected\r\nstudents for two days. The selected students\r\nwilling to become administrative staff of the\r\nschool are chosen by personnel of the school\r\nthrough real elections. However, those who\r\nwant to the educational staff for two days are\r\nelected by relevant teachers. Each teacher\r\nchooses one student to take his place.\r\nThe objectives of the plan include:\r\n* Respecting students as builders of future\r\nsociety;\r\n* Boosting sense of responsibility among\r\nstudents;\r\n* Increasing self-reliance among students;\r\n* Improving managerial skills of students;\r\n* Bolstering positive social and cultural\r\nrelations;\r\n* Creating necessary motivations for\r\ninternalizing personal discipline;\r\n* Boosting empathy across schools;\r\n* Qualitative upliftment of educational\r\nperformance of students;\r\nSocial aspects of the plan:\r\nSince civilization means rule of law, on-time\r\nresponding, assuming responsibility and\r\ntaking power through legal channels and\r\nsince there are many incongruities in this\r\nregard in our society, creating suitable\r\nculture in the field of education is a must.\r\nHypotheses:\r\n1. The Plan for Managing School by\r\nStudents is effective in making\r\neducational environment more\r\ndelightful.\r\n2. The plan would play a major role in\r\nboosting self-reliance among students.\r\n3.

Self-reliance test of Cupper Smith;\r\n3. Leadership skills questionnaire.\r\nConclusion:\r\nDesigning educational programs to\r\nincrease flexibility and openness of\r\nthe currently closed educational\r\nsystem is necessary. In other words,\r\nthe present system has failed to lead\r\nto creation of purposeful behavior,\r\nself-regulating behavioral models, as\r\nwell as increased sense of\r\nresponsibility among students.\r\nOn the other hand, based on\r\nstatistics, depression is rising among\r\nchildren.

The school has already organised four international conferences of Chief Justices of the World — the 5th Conference being scheduled from 10th to 12th December later this year and is expected to draw Chief Justices from over 50 countries — where the highlight is presentation of an appeal on behalf of world two billion children demanding enactment of enforceable international laws by a duly constituted World Parliament for safeguarding children\'s right to inherit a safe and healthy ecology.\r\n\r\nCMS believes that not only the USA but the entire world needs a guardian who will lead his global family to freedom and security. This is no campaign stunt, but a sincere request to the media to read these words in the light of America\'s future role in establishing world peace through collective global governance. On that count, these 28 words make USA\'s policy statement for the entire world.\r\n\r\nCMS also believes that Nobel laureate Jan Tinbergen was not out of place when he said, “National Governments can no longer solve world problems, what is needed is World Government.” Albert Einstein, Winston Churchill, Jawahar Lal Nehru, former UN Assistant Secretary General Robert Muller also spoke loud on the need for a world government. \r\n\r\nFormer US President John F. Kennedy had said: “Mankind must put an end to war, or war will put and end to mankind.” His statement reflects that he also had the world government on his mind—as wars cannot be put to end without the armour of “Enforceable Global law” and his mind—as wars cannot be put to end without the armour of “Enforceable Global law” and to enact such a law you need a global parliament.\r\n\r\nAccording to CMS, John Kerry\'s 28 words have won him a great following on this side of the Himalayas, which has always lent the global soundtrack its one-sixth decibel voice. CMS upholds that Kerry is right when he says we need \"...the president who doesn\'t walk away from the world...\" the president who doesn\'t walk away from the world...\" A true leader will always involve himself with the world (affairs) and look after its interests rather than his own. Everybody knows who has failed to do so? \r\n\r\nCMS infers that the hint is loud and clear — you cannot be a world leader if you promote ‘bush-fighting’ (guerrilla warfare) in Afghanistan and Iraq. This bushcraft (art of living in bushes) can only help one keep alive in the global backwoods, but it cannot make one a world leader! Definitely, you aren’t beating about the bush here! This is more than an assurance when Kerry says “…instead he (the US President) would lead the nations of the world into a new era of security, freedom and peace for all.” \r\n\r\nCMS believes that what Kerry is suggesting here is that what had happened at the UN Millennium Summit held on 6th, 7th & 8th September 2000 was wrong? The Clause 8 of the UN General Assembly Agenda item 30 of the 53rd Session (dated 10th May 1999), which had offered a meaningful discussion on initiating a ‘New International Political and Economic Order’ for the new century, could not be discussed because of unhealthy manipulations. The new millennium is already four years old now and the world is still waiting for the new-era bus to hit the road. As is clear to all, the United Nations Organisation is now unfit to handle the fast changing world affairs. \r\n\r\nThe world seems to be waiting for a leader who steers it into a new political and economic order and CMS believes that in John Kerry, the world has a visionary capable of leading \"the nations of the world into a new era of security, freedom and peace for all.\" \r\n--------------------\r\nKerry\'s Millennium Statement\r\nAnalyzing Kerry\'s 28-word Key to Global Governance\r\n\"The USA today needs a president who will not walk away from the world, but instead lead the nations of the world into a new era of security, freedom and peace for all.\" - John Kerry.\r\n---------------\r\nEach word in the 28-word statement carries John\'s promise, vision and determination of a future world leader and global governance. Each bold letter is pregnant with meaning, and readily delivers its perspective future relevance.\r\n\r\n(1) & (2) The USA will have to rise as the United States of World (USW). \r\n(3) Today is grim, and tomorrow can be peaceful only under an effective global leadership. \r\n(4) Needs of all countries can be addressed only through a duly elected world government.\r\n(5) A President of the world government can alone address global issues with unbiased zeal and humane immediacy.\r\n(6) Who will have his identity as a global citizen and not as an ABC belonging to an XYZ country.\r\n(7) Will of the peoples of the world shall form his coalition agenda and mandate.\r\n(8) Not falling to a group, neither following a lobby nor succumbing to bureaucratic pressures — common welfare will be his goal to achieve.\r\n(9) Walk-ing hand in hand with all the countries, he will lead the world with enforceable laws to economic and political freedom.\r\n(10) Away from poverty, hunger, terror and destruction, he will take the world to peace and prosperity.\r\n(11) From death to life, from deprivation to equal opportunities, from chaos to peace, will be his plan of action.\r\n(12) World is but one family will be his pledge.\r\n(13) But, his governance will punish the wrong doer and protect the do-gooder.\r\n(14) Instead of multi-currency economies, he would promote one-currency norm.\r\n(15) Lead-ing all onto the path of growth and economic welfare will be his mission.\r\n(16) Nations will work as dynamic members of the global family under his leadership.\r\n(17) Of the world, by the world and for the world will be the constitution of the global government.\r\n(18) World-over-individual will be the key governance mantra.\r\n(19) Into the world would mean a global citizen working for common safety, common security and common freedom.\r\n(20) New world order can only come when we leave our prejudices and devise a tool to achieve it.\r\n(21) Era of good feeling (US history terms Monroe period as \'era of good feeling\') will definitely come with a democratic global governance.\r\n(22) Of the world will be the citizen and of the citizen will be the world.\r\n(23) Security for all will be the effect of good global governance.\r\n(24) Freedom for all will be the effect of that security.\r\n(25) And prosperity for all will be the effect of that freedom.\r\n(26) Peace will be the cause of that prosperity.\r\n(27) For all and not for me, him or them will form the edifice of global government.\r\n(28) All for peace and peace for all will make its very foundation.\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n',0,'',0,0,'','','NULL','2004-06-07 00:00:00','2004-06-10 00:00:00','');

There are also religious education classes, which are of course, optional. In addition to this, there is a new program that is under way - the program of socialization and integration of Gypsy children in our school. Enabling these children to get proper education is very human, and our school\'s policy is that everyone deserves a chance. I think that people at our school are very open minded and progressive, there are also plans to create a multimedia classroom; simply, they\'re doing everything they can to make this school become more developed. My school is taking care that their students have a healthy life style; therefore, they organize different seminars on this matter. All these activities help us to think of our school as of our second home, a place where we belong.

We contacted the Japanese community in our city, planted Gingko Bilobas in 3 schools (as a symbol of our work together), made 1000 cranes with peace messages which were given to people in two squares of our city. Students expressed what peace meant for them through paintings and drawings, and wrote passages and essays about their feelings against war and terrorism and their consequences.

This move will modify school culture and needs to be supported by changes in curriculum to be totally effective. \r\nOur institutional project started in the year 2004. All actions were planned in advance to develop communication and understanding as the main tools to achieve peace. To facilitate this process the participants needed guidance, leadership and planning of a committed and enthusiastic group of teachers who affected staff and students in the school, so it was essential to be well planned and organized. We worked to promote peace everywhere at any time; to care for ourselves and thus, to care for others by putting into practice cleaning up campaigns and mediation of conflicts. One of the main discussions led the students to reject the use of nuclear weapons. An outstanding action among students was to foster the Olympic ideals to serve peace, friendship and understanding in the world and following the Greek tradition of the Olympic Movement.\r\nIn this first step parents were not included as part of the project; but this year they will have the opportunity to participate in the project and understand the reasons for the programme and the likely impact on their children.

One of the biggest steps in this development has been the decision to become a \"health promoting school\" that is UNESCO, UNICEF and World Health Organization project, the major aim which is education for all and for all life time. Acting in this project one of the basic tasks of our school is health education – knowledge, students active work – activities, co-operation, improvement of school and environment.

The moto of health promotive school is \"We are learning for life, not for school\". And how wouldn’t it in a school with this atmosphere form a wish to reach something more on an international level?

To us, the students of this school, these projects give a chance to get acquainted with people of different nationalities and even travel to our dream lands.

Mid-Term World Report 2005.\r\nThis is the selected essay where thirty students participated: It was selected by teachers; they are on the photo (only 3, Eduardo, Ana Maria and Gladys) but 10 teachers in this school participate.\r\n \r\nA CULTURE OF PEACE AT OUR SCHOOL.Student. LUIS ZENIS.- 17 years old. Coordinator in school Gladys Hernández \r\n \r\nPeace is both the political and spiritual union of each state in the world. How can we reach it? Each person must promote his own inner peace in order to promote actions directed to our environment, which will allow us to be humble with our parents, relatives, and any human being close to us, being this person either rich or poor. We can reach this through understanding and love. \r\nWe wish a world where everybody may have food, a clear environment unpolluted, without wars, and where each person will be respected no matter his religious ideas,. \r\nOnly by electing a leader who promotes actions directed towards peace, we will be very close to reach global peace.\r\n\r\nThe actions we are carrying out with the support of other teachers and students of the country nearby, lead towards the integration of two nations* in order to develop a Culture in favor of Peace, are historical events that direct towards love between the two countries. These actions seem not to be enough in a global context, but it is remarkable that we are a group which is taking actions to reach peace.\r\n\r\nTeachers, students, relatives, and all those people who are following a process of integration among countries, especially the people who live in the Chilean and Peruvian bordering, are promoting a development of a culture for peace where each person, without losing his own sense of identity, may embrace the foreigner as a brother.\r\n\r\nI would like to finish this reflection by saying that a border is nothing but an imaginary line which divides a territory; especially in Latin America where people speak the same language, share similar customs and the same roots which come from our common ancestors. \r\n\r\n* (Chile & Peru, comment by HL) \r\n\r\nAdded information:\r\nAt 14:04 2005-04-23 +0000, you wrote:\r\n\r\nDear Life-Link\r\nAbout the Culture of Peace report: \r\n1. Could you with a few words say that your school has made progress during the years 2001-2005? And why have you made progress in your peace education? \r\n2. Do you find any problems / obstacles in peace education at your school? (Money? Teachers obstruction? Parents or politicians unwillingness? etc\r\n\r\nANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS\r\n1. People who are participating in the project such as teachers, students and administrative people\r\n since 2001 to 2005 have shown a positive change in their state of mind in relationship to Peace\r\n Culture, especially those who have been working at this high school since 2001 besides that, the students who have finished their studies and have entered the university.\r\n All of them have felt an inner change, they have become true leaders who loves Peace and take care of the environment.\r\n When people come in our High School they can feel our positive attitude. Besides that the community knows about the work done by the young students through the newspaper.\r\n\r\n2. We have been making progress in Peace Culture due to the support of Life-Link, that stimulates us to continue working in our project. We can feel this stimulus when we receive the answer to our report in the web page.\r\nI have also coordinated a good team of teachers in the city. They are 21 and they all come from different schools and high schools from thr city. We are all involved in the actions taken in the project. We haven’t had any problem with parents or other people.\r\nMoney is necessary for us to transfer students and others needs but we have solved the problem \r\nWith our budget. We have financed the trips or vice versa. Most of the time we have paid the\r\nmoney taken from our salaries but I am happy to do my best .\r\nWhy can I work with other teachers of different schools and a lot of students in the Life Link Program?\r\nI help them improve their communications skills, expose them to a variety of opportunities inside and outside the school (working with different divisions, going to conferences and trade shows, etc.), try to understand where they want to go and help them understand what they need to get there.\r\n\r\n2001 – 2005.\r\n\r\nThe high school becomes beautiful due to the saving of water ,about 50% , that allows us to use the water again. This project was carried out (initiated) by Life – Link. It was financed by CONAMA. We saved 50% of water , the water from the sink is accumulated in a drum connected to a motor. When it is functioning the water goes out from the drum through an underground pipe to water the gardens. It’s beautiful because we live in a desert region. Besides that, young people are taking care of the trash cans, All the classrooms have one inside it.\r\n I have contributed with guide designs to teach them how to respect themselves, and other people who are taking care of the environment, the water, and solid recycler.\r\n\r\nThe guides will be taught to the students once a month in each subject because they are adapted to all of them. Besides that, students will learn short stories. It depends on the age of the students.\r\n\r\n I want to tell you that through this Project of Integration between frontiers. We were able to edit\r\nA bi-national book, that has short stories, a flora and fauna guide from both cities. We followed the Program designed by MINEDUC from both countries, this text is the result of many meetings among teachers from both countries, in Mr. Eduardo Peralta who is a teacher of History contributed to this field. We are both Chilean this text is being used by Peruvian teachers Tacna. It is a text for fourth Elementary level, designed for nine years old children. There are two texts for Arica.

In the program of this activity, children had to introduce posters, slogans, songs. They also demonstrated their knowledge in school subjects: Geography. Biology, Chemistry, Ecology \r\nand others. A more important thing is that they discussed actual ecological problems of our region and measures that should be taken to make the situation better.\r\nWe have also organized a wonderful Festival of foreign languages. It helped us to learn more about different countries of the world and to be closer to their cultures. Children of all classes have taken part in questionnaires, shows, plays and a great \r\nconcert. \r\nBut the most important activities have been performed and made in connection with \r\nthe celebration of the 60th anniversary of the heroic victory of the Soviet Army over the fascist invaders in the Great Patriotic war 1941-1945 which led to the liberation of many European peoples from fascist oppression. Children took part in History and literature contests, organized meetings with veterans, visited historic places connected with this \r\nevent, prepared presents and performed a really unforgettable show for veterans with a lot of songs, poetry, dramas and music.

The basic aims of the actions mentioned above are to teach students to be polite in everyday situations, especially with their friends and teachers; to give social support for children with special needs for whom it is difficult to get integrated in our society; to warm sick people’s hearts and souls, to help them forget their sorrows and illnesses even for a moment and to take care of our environment as we are friends of nature.\r\nIn addition, history is the formation of a thorough attitude towards person’s experience. The formation of a historical memory and a civil position through various subjects and events develops values and improves human relationship.

Peace in Middle East….\r\nThere are conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians for just a small portion of a land, while people were killing themselves.

We need to love our neighbor as our self as it was said in the Holy Bible.\r\n2.	What wrong with the Governments..?\r\nIn Africa for instance, there were a very serious civic war between Government and the Opposition especially in Cote d”Ivoir, Liberia, DR Congo, Togo and Sierra Leone, where there’s no peace among them selves.\r\n3	Ways to enrich your marriage..?\r\nMarriage is the union between two people who are usually a man and woman who agree to stay together as husband and wife and recognized by the two families that is the family of the both man and the woman.

I am very glad to send them to you.\r\n\r\n\"The screaming of an ant\"\r\nTo walk through the wet grass hearing the voice of the Earth and the voice of the sky, uniting you with the universe, but remaining yourself. \r\nThe world means variety: different cultures, different religions, different races, all reunited under an only name: humanity. It is tried the promoting of a culture of peace and universal peace, but this feeling it\'s being stopped by some mentalities and prejudices.\r\nWe live in a world of hate, a selfish world, a world that\'s always in a hurry, a world in which harmony is completely lacking. Day by day we see bare, lifeless eyes with no soul glitter behind them, looks starving for money and power…\r\nDaily we stomp on sensitive people enlightened minds… The human kind is heading to the abyss … Souls die, vanish… The voice of humanity is like the screaming of an ant. Exactly like in the earliest beginnings of the world there is a fight for survival, for supremacy.\r\nThe soul ended up with the last place and drops of life flow in nothingness. Time is running and we don’t care. We live long shallow lives.\r\nFeelings are for sale, art started to slowly disappear and the upraising soul is agonizing.\r\nWe use death as a weapon that is available to anyone and wars became a toy in the hands of power…\r\n “Quo vadis...?” this should be the question. It would be impossible to answer it. Would we know ever again to complete harmony? Humanity will ever again close itself in a ring, or it will form a chain of love?\r\nLove means life; from it everything else takes birth… That’s why we should learn love one another and in a while we should go away from our computers and wash our eyelashes with the dew drops on a leaf from which the life vibrates.(Alexandra Marola, 16)\r\n \r\n\"High-school Anthems\"\r\nAs he stands before the rusty gates of knowledge, he bares in mind not the hope for a bright future, or the desire to make the world a better place. Instead he is consumed by the tormenting lust for acceptance, that some people spend their whole lives searching for.\r\nHis legs are weary, as he makes his first steps into embracing the high-school experience. What thoughts blaze the mind of this demure 15 year-old? Fear...He does not know the way he will evolve in this new environment, and it frightens him. Although physically present, fear and uncertainty carry his soul on an emotional Embargo, for he feels untouchable, yet vulnerable in the same time. \r\nContrary to general belief, moral and cultural values within my generation are not fading away. Some teenagers are lured into the obscure world of drugs and alcohol, and it is because of this why today’s\' youth is frowned upon.\r\nThe main motive why my generation is perceived as lost, is envy. Between the walls of a high-school every emotion is lived with such intensity and such passion, that it amazes older people. Life, in its purest and most beautiful form, is rapidly circulating through the veins of every high-school student. People in the second age-group have lost the ability to relish life in this way, and thus, ravaged by envy, they mostly display anger.\r\nWhat does one do in front of the great unknown? Some questions are better left unanswered. As to what the future will bring, only time will tell. (Bogdan Moisa,16) \r\n\r\n\r\nOur eye sight is a test for us to see if we are perceptive enough. Ask yourself “Do I see?” do you really see things around you? Of course we cannot love everyone, kiss everyone, like hippies did in the 70’s, 80’s. We cannot love everything that breathes only because we are nearly human.\r\nThe peace sign. Peace is old, we have created other generations, “improved” ones, yes, improved; now hate, pessimism, violence is a lot more. We must be better. These generations have not missed any way of debasement. Peace got off the stage, has ran to seed. Who wouldn’t laugh if you now showed the peace sign? It is our fault. We think we are limited in the world we are living in; meantime we are the ones who set the limits. If we can accept that this world is only a fake, then everything would be possible. Tomorrow, I am going to show “peace” to the people in my school, and they are going to laugh. But I won’t seek the escape in running. I will seek the youth of my school in nature. Someone said that the dreamer is condemned to live in obscurity. But I will dream a youth condemned to live anywhere, but just condemned to live. Tomorrow, I will understand, because I understood life, in a previously lived one. \r\nDo not turn the blind eye on peace. If we, teenagers cannot carry our own point, then we will be lost. We will be driven to the wall and we will just feel pity for ourselves for all our lives.\r\nI will dream that we will get out of this cloud…\r\n…but then…will I wake up?

A world in which selfishness overwhelmes us like in a floating scarf and gets deeply into our mind and soul. Selfishness turns into envy then into hatred, spite, which destroys us gradually. We look for people who might be guilty for what happens to us. Thus we reach the most frightful enemy of ours: violence. We stick to it in order not to feel loaded morally, putting aside the sensibility. We get rid of everything what characterized us: kindness, inner beauty, dignity.\r\nWhen seeing such a person we wonder why he is like this. And if we try to give an answer we come to a conclusion: this behaviour is the result of an unhappy childhood.\r\nMany parents love their children, they give them food, clothes, love and understanding. But others consider their children a burden. They don’t love and understand them and more than this, they are violent with them. Such an attitude towards a child can have undesired consequences: in turn, this child becomes violent, irresponsible, indifferent, he lacks tolerance and dignity. Thus we realize how important it is for us to forgive, to be non-violent with this child and, even if we don’t have enough material possibilities, to offer him everything we can afford. Let us be tolerant so that this silver ray could follow our example and could become neither the most famous person, nor the most intelligent or beautiful, but a real true man.\r\nWe all could try to become PEOPLE in case we haven’t already become, showing tolerance and interest in children, helping those who are poor, being happy for those who have everything they want and, moreover, opening the gates of our souls for those who encountered only locked hearts.\r\nOnly in this way we can feel we are human beings for real.

Naturally, we are not able to know everything about every country or nationality. \r\nThe main reason for that is the fact that people create stereotypes and prejudice against each other. We develop stereotypes when we are unwilling to obtain all the information we would need to make fair judgments about people. For example, you can often hear people saying “All Germans are Nazi warmongers”, or “south-west Lithuanians are greedy and mean”. Or \"All teenagers love rock-n-roll have no respect for their elders.\", whereas the elderly complain about young people being not respectful. However, all these stereotypes are used primarily as a tool to express popular beliefs about people. When we judge people based on our prejudice and treat them differently, we are engaged in discrimination.

Others are ignoring it and hoping it will go away. Still others don’t even seem to care. However, the facts are undeniable. Violence cause children to be violent and effects can be lifelong. \r\nChildren can’t feel safe even at their home. The parents are the child’s role models from which he learns. He can learn at an early age that violence is bad, education should start at home, but not in every family children could get the best education. There are families where parents are alcohol addicts or drug addicts. Children get the first lessons of aggression and violence at home. Empty bottles, cigarettes, aggression, quarreling parents, some children experience every day.\r\nWhy are teenagers so cruel to friends? \r\nViolent television, films, parents do affect children. They become aggressive and cruel. \r\nViolence can destroy a young child’s mind. The effects of violence can be long- lasting, if not never- ending. The children like imitating the behavior of models have seen on TV, films. Shown heroes on TV are more attractive for them. \r\nAggressive behavior is more acceptable in the cities. We’ve heard a lot of accidents at schools in the bigger cities.

We, in the action groups, are all together going everywhere, taking and solving problems and of course, helping to each other.

I have my own garden and my pets (dogs, dwarf hens and roosters, love birds, fishes, one turtle). \r\nWhen I get to school though, I meet my friends and it seems like everything it’s back to normal.\r\nOur school-mistress understands that during the breaks we have to play with our toys and she tries to get us as close to each other as possible.

I think I will give it to my teacher, she will know what to do with it. She will find a friend for it. During the first school-semester of our life, our teacher helped each of us to find among us the best friend for sharing the desk with, so that everything goes well during the classes. \r\nOne day, we have started building a small town in our classroom. Each of us made a part of the town. I’ve built a gas station. My desk mate built a block of flats. My apartment was in his block and he was filling his car with fuel from my station. Nobody was paying for the service and we were all pleased. I guess, because somehow we were depending on each other so, everyone should take care for the other. We were like a team.\r\nCristina built a Hospital and she was a doctor. None of us was ill but, the Hospital was still, as the teacher said, crowded with children from another country. Some of the children were ill because of starvation, others injured by bombs and bullets. Some of the children were white, other children were black. When we go to school, our teacher is asking us „What did you bring today for the poor children in the Hospital?” Of course, it’s all in our imagination.\r\nOne day, I fetched my turtle to school (without my mother’s knowledge) because, I knew this should be the best gift for a suffering child. It will make him fill better and take away the loneliness.\r\nSince that day, we have a turtle, a fish bowl and some flowers in our classroom.

And it is\r\nawareness, brought about by action, which we have been promoting for several years. To better achieve this goal, we started at an educational level by offering students the opportunity to work together and also to establish contact with international organizations and youth groups all over the world. In order to reach visible results, we founded a local\r\nnetwork made up of various clubs: Earth Day, Life-Link, Clean up the World, Peace Child, Sokrate, Eco Club. The network has proven to be extremely\r\nefficient given the fact that every year it allows us to organize more than one hundred thematic events in collaboration with local and national authorities.\r\nOne of the most important values we have promoted during the last few years is tolerance, mainly because we consider lack of tolerance to be the root of war. In the spirit of tolerance we have organized numerous workshops, student meetings, IT presentations, symposiums, MUN conferences,\r\nKP and Lincoln-Douglas debates. \r\nConcerned about major health issues we have developed a partnership with the local council, hospitals and Public Health Department so as to have reliable sources of information for our campaigns: “AIDS aid”, “Healthy food-Chew on it”, “Feed your brain”, “First aid skills”, “Don’t let the\r\ndrugs in”.\r\nAlarmed by the fact that human activity is constantly and irreversibly harming the environment, we have tried to compensate for the damage. Every week in the past three years, the surroundings of our high school and the center of our city have been cleaned by volunteers of our local Eco Club. Given the fact that we live on the bank of the severely polluted Danube we are organizing clean-ups every semester. Through our recycling campaigns C.N.V.A. teenagers have managed to link all schools from Galati county and gathered more than 100 tons of paper, plastic and metals. We have planted indigenous species of trees in order to prevent the Danube’s promenade from collapsing into the Danube and also to lower the level of pollution our\r\nlocal metal plant causes. As important as these was to make the idea of helping the environment a popular one among the youth in our community,\r\nwhich we achieved by organizing numerous contests and expositions on ecological themes with great impact on the viewers. It was crucial for us to create a strong link between our members and collaboration was enhanced by the many activities which implied team work.

The Apple Day is special because it is also interesting for students.Preparing for this big day begins from early September so that we can have a great manifestation on 20 October. That day every student brings to school something made of apples –this special and useful fruit. We organise humanitarian action –we take some of what is brought to some center- for children who lost their parents in war or to the center for old people. That is how we show how is important to share our happiness with others. Our students also oganise a party and invite students from others schools whats interesting and good for making friendships between them.\r\nWe have a good experience with this action so we recommend it to every member of your organization because it expresses humanity and humanity is the best way to prevent war.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n',0,'',0,0,'','','NULL','2005-04-27 00:00:00','2005-04-30 00:00:00','Members of Life-Link club from First Bosniak Highschool-(Sarajevo-Bosnia and Herzegvina)\r\nProfessor:Amira Karađuzović,Students:Nejla Bajrović\r\n Lamija Subašić ');

Unfortunately children are very delicate & sensitive so that any single small thing can harm their feelings & it may leave an unforgettable spot in their memories. And because children are our bright future we must work together in order to keep them as far as possible from violence.\r\nIn the first step, we should bare in mind that protecting these pure souls is not only by ending children abuse but also by preventing them from being abused. If we get a little bit closer to reality we can touch the ugly problem; children are being treated badly, cruelly & actually violently. At home, for example, so many parents try to manage their kids problems by beating or yelling, not knowing that this awful behavior will create new & maybe worst problems.\r\nIn my opinion parents should be more aware in dealing with their kids. Moreover education, especially schools play the main role in building young people\'s characters, because as we all know students spend most of their time at school environment.\r\nBut the problem is that teachers usually use tough punishments including aggressive indications that may scratch students feelings in order to gain silence, not caring to the effects of these unpleasant ways. All these bad treatments may lead to deeper problems beginning from being violent with their friends then causing to be school leavers & finally ending with becoming criminals.\r\nAnd still, this is not the real problem…...we are still unable to define violence correctly; Violence is not only to deal with others with a stick near by, or to talk loudly. this is only one side of it, its something as the sword it has two effects; it can threaten others & it can hurt the body itself.\r\nIn fact every human being regardless how old he is has feelings that if it gets hurt it will never be cured again. I believe that prevention is the key to success & that all of us must be one hand to prevent violence to obtain world full of peace.\r\n\r\nUnder the title \"A Culture of Peace at our School\" we had a competition between two teams from the school in one day work.

During these lessons I comprehend and watch how the children build their moral on the base of their knowledge. This development is all-sided. Every child tells his points of view and listens to the others.\r\nThe pupils were given a question: What is the most important knowledge they have received this year? Their answers surprised me. They are only 9-year\r\npupils but they answered wonderfully. I didn\'t expect to receive individual and valuable answers as they gave. It was like a discussion. Here are their\r\nanswers:\r\n1.If I lie once, next time nobody will believe me.\r\n2. If I am not friendly with others, I\'ll lose my friends.\r\n3.It is necessary to love nature and live in harmony with it.\r\n4.

It can also be seen as a sense of order that is provided by law or custom.\r\nPeace can also be broken down and enjoyed as agreeing to end enmity.\r\nLastly, peace is seen as harmony in personal relationship that is associated with thought and emotions.\r\nALL OVER THE WORLD “ CULTURE OF PEACE” has been much talked about. There have been conferences and seminars to that effect.\r\nThe culture of peace based on the definition of the word “peace” can be talked about in many forms. \r\nIt could be peace in a nation, the peace between nations and peace in a relationship, or peace in a family.\r\nBefore the first and second world wars in 1814-1818 and 1939-1945 respectively, there was the war between Israel and Palestine, which up to date ranges on.\r\nNations that fought against themselves in those world wars have reconciled and have united. These nations are Germany, France, America, Former Soviet Union and the rest. These countries are even having permanent seats on the UN Security Council.\r\nIn recent times, there have been many lack of peace in most part of the world notably Africa and the Middle East.\r\nIn the Middle East for example, America together with United Kingdom invaded Iraq in search of weapons of Mass Destruction.\r\nUp-to-date no such weapons have been found in Iraq. Despite the U.N’s call to allow weapons. Inspectors headed by Hans Bliss at that time to allow them enough time to do their inspections, America defied the call and had to attack Iraq in the year 2003. \r\nOf all these, innocent lives of women and children are the most lost. Huge countries including Russia, Germany, France and Japan opposed the war, Not forgetting the late Pope John Paul II. \r\nWhen you delve into this issue you would be tempted to believe that power struggle could be an unfair cause for a war.\r\nIn America itself, terrorist groups masterminded by Osama Bin Laden of Saudi origin on September 11th in 2002 bound major buildings.\r\nOn the continent of Africa, the culture of peace is very devastating. Most countries of Africa, in one way or the other, have had political instabilities since independence and postcolonial rule.\r\nIt happened in Angola where the UNITA rebels leader Jonas Savimdi was killed in cold blood.\r\nIn Sierra Leone, RUPF rebel movement headed by Foday Sankoh had a long battle with the government of Valentine Strausses and Ahmed Tejan Kassah.\r\nThe same can be said about Liberia where diamond dealings was the bone of contention between the rebels leader of Charles Taylor and Samuel Doe before his death and Charles Taylor’s election as president.\r\nThe story in Africa is pity because, during these times of wars, various diseases emerges some of which are cholera, ebola, malnutrition and tuberculosis.\r\nThe most recent act of gross disregard for the rule of law is the situations in Darfus, Ivory Coast and Togo\r\nThe situation in Darfus has received interactional condemnations including the UN Sec. Gen. Kofi Annan who has described the situation as “hell on earth”. It is said to note that, the government of Omar Al- Basher is sponsoring millitia groups to fight people in the western part of Sudan (Darfus). \r\nAlmost all the inhabitants are fleeing to seek people and asylum in countries nearby.\r\nSome have come as far as Ghana from that northern part of Africa. The situation is so pathetic that irresponsible won Sudanese have applied for refugee status in countries like Spain and Italy since these nations are across the pacifics from Sudan.\r\nAssessing events from time immemorial through to the middle of peace the 20th century and the latter part of the 21st century one world say that, the “culture of peace” has improved in the developed countries.\r\nAnd the third world countries, old traditions and lack of education coupled with power and political struggle are the causes of crimes against humanity.\r\nIf governments in third world countries can spend more on education and they can really develop their natural resources, there would not be any need for every government or group of people wanting power and wanting to hold on to it.\r\nThere must be the respect for rule of law laid down rules and regulations must be obeyed, suspected criminals must be tried in competent courts and no form of coup d’etats must be tolerated.\r\nLastly every stakeholder must be involved in decision-making. Each other’s view must be respected and at the end of it all elections must be held in a free, fair and transparent manner\r\nPeople must not see themselves as enemies but one people.

It is the good way for the development of the intellect and the approach to the science.\r\nWe began our activity with the nature, ecology and its fluency at the alive organism. The main point of our activity is the forming of the strong personality in the spirit and physical aspects.\r\nMost of the children go in for sports and it helps in forming of the right mentality.\r\nWe organized such actions as “WE are against drugs, ACID, smoking”, the result of them was the memorandum.\r\nIt is known that the most of the illnesses are caused by the fear, the anger, the spite. But our negative emotions, feelings should be changed by the love, so we teach how to use the positive way of the thinking.\r\nOur last conference was devoted to the problem of the Kindness and the Evil.\r\nWe know that 5000 years ago in China, Egypt, Greece, Rome and India the methods of the treatment without medicines were very popular and effective. So we try to show at our conferences that the possibilities of our organism are endless. The proofs of this are such methods as Indian yoga, Chinese dance thai-chi.\r\nThe main aim of our conferences is the harmonious and natural development of the person. We also try to teach our students how to raise the capacity for work, to balance the nervous system and to avoid the nervous and physical overloads.\r\nWe propose to you the summary of our conference. Our main topic for two years was “The Secret Wisdom of The Human Body”.\r\nOur emblem is twofaced Yanus: people know that the understanding of the Present and the Future is in the studying of the Past.\r\nMany outstanding philosophers, scientists and writers proved this in their works, among them Aristotle, Confucius, Goethe, Hugo. The main idea of their works is concentrated in the fact that the care, service to people are the greatest virtues of our life , but the egoism, the indifference, the spite are the biggest deficiency.\r\nOur conference is international. We understand that all people need the lesson of the care and the kindness. The positive thoughts and the positive words embodied in our life are the main way of the good influence at each other.\r\nThe young generation wants to know everything, so we are very interested in understanding of these dogmas with the help of the Science. The new century, the century of the Biology and Astronomy will help us to answer the questions: who we are; why we are here; how the kindness can overcome the evil. \r\nThe work of our conferences was concentrated at the understanding of some facts of nontraditional treatment with the scientific point of view. It was rather difficult. The material that we found allowed us to organize the conferences:\r\n2001- “ The Energy of the Universe and the Person”\r\n2003-“ The Way to the Health, the Beauty and the Success”\r\nWorking out of the last conference we analyzed the main illnesses of our students, we organized the questionnaire, visited the families. We worked out the way how to approach the best result- by the good regime, the diet, the physical exercises, meditations and others. \r\nToday we continue to talk about the health and discuss the main questions: how we can help the kindness to overcome the evil.\r\nThe students who take part in the conferences prepare the reports devoted to the most interesting facts. Lets look at some of them.\r\n*Studying the Genetics we discuss the scientific methods of the heredity. We tried to explain the methods of “dermatoglific”. It is connected with the tactful sensibility. The author of this report spoke about the receptors, the most sensible parts of our body.

They investigate the structure of those parts of our brains that regulate our behavior. Our boys show the exercises for eyes that are very useful.\r\n*Our emotions take very important part in our life. They are connected with the work of all parts of our organism and depend on the right nutrition and biochemistry of our brains. This problem was investigated by Anfisa Razdjakonova.\r\n*Fedor Povoroznuk tries to understand the cause of the negative reactions such as the anger, the envy.\r\n*Marina Zolotukhina speaks about the nutrition that helps to raise our brains activity, she gives the advises of the right regime.\r\n*Anna Ivanova is sure that the movement is the fundament of our life.\r\n*Tatiana Zinovieva investigates the question of our genes. The main point of her report is the cause of our negative actions and the mental illnesses.\r\n*Ekaterina Glukhmanchuk speaks about very serious illness: Porphyria. What is the cause of it? How can we help the patient? Ekaterina tries to answer.\r\n*Vitally Tulin advises everybody to smile and to laugh. His report proves why we should do this.\r\n*Olga Philippova speaks about the dangerous illnesses and the ways how to avoid them. One of the most effective way is the vaccination.\r\n*The problem of stress was investigated by Katya Kashevarova. She is sure that our negative emotions influence our organism and evoke the serious illness. The participants of the conference show ho to overcome the stress end the depression with the help of dances, physical exercises.\r\n*Olga Egurneva shows the methods of the relaxation, they are very useful, simple and can be used in any situation you want.\r\n*Yuliya Kuzmina and Andrey Lomov investigate the method of the Biological Return Connection, that was worked out by Aleksandr Smetankin.

New students have passed examinations and entered the lyceum. Obviously, it was different for many students to get used to new teachers, subjects and traditions of our lyceum.\r\nAt the beginning of November all new students became the lyceum students. It was quite an event and there was a remarkable celebration here. All students were given the lyceum certificates by our head master and the professors of “MIFI” University. The journalists and reporters paid their attention on this event and we were shown on TV. So, students’ parents were proud of them. But frankly speaking, it is only the promising beginning of our studying, where we’ll be helped by our teachers and friends. Now we respect and try to follow all traditions of the first Russian Pushkin’s lyceum\r\n2)Recently we became the lyceum. Our students participate in different actions with the help our teachers. The teachers always give us suitable advice. In November we organized “Book fair”. The main purpose of it was not only commercial, but also educational. We got to know how to cooperate with each other, how to be independent and responsible for our actions. First, we informed the student about the book fair. We made up the Estimate Group for then goods valuing. Every student had a great opportunity to take part in the fair, where books, toys, CD, DVD … were sold. After the fair, the lyceum Parliament got money as the tax from sales.\r\nWe are sure that such actions like giving the students an opportunity to use their own knowledge and experience are interesting\r\n3) As we are the lyceum students, we wear the form of our lyceum and special badges on it. In spite of the strict rules, we are modern generation full of energy, enthusiasm and bright individuality. Taking all these facts into consideration, we have the lyceum parliament. It consists of our students and is responsible to solve students’ problems. Everyone in our lyceum is able to address to the parliament.\r\nFor example: recently the parliament has discussed Saturday form wearing.\r\nIt goes without saying, that all our teachers are ready to help and listen to us. Every student can be heard, in spite of our age. It’s one of the best examples of lyceum democracy. As for students they all try to do their best and be good at every subject.(there a lot of them here) After passing all our tests, the lyceum parliament organizes students’ discos, where we dance, talk and have a good time. After this we are in a good mood and are able to overcome all difficulties.\r\nSo, we are happy to study here and be famous for our high education.\r\n\r\n',0,'',0,0,'','','NULL','2006-01-11 00:00:00','2006-01-14 00:00:00','Administration of Marino district, «Marinsky Vestnik» newspaper');

After World War II it was a school for educating future teachers and since 1950 it is an elementary school. In 1955 our school got its present name Jovan Jovanovic Zmaj, after the famous children\'s poet. Since 1956 the education is carried out in two languages: Serbian and Hungarian.\r\n\r\nOur school has been the host of the traditional annual gathering of children and teachers from schools with the same name as ours for three times. For many years we have been hosting the reciting competition in Hungarian language. For 10 years we have been hosting the regional competition in physics under the supervision of the Ministry of Education.\r\n\r\nToday our school has 673 students who attend the classes from 1st to the 8th grade and 52 teachers who teach those students and the psychologist and pedagogue. The two active Life-Link teachers are Dragana Cupurdija, the psyhologist and Dorottya Kalinic, the English teacher.\r\nOur school is located in the town centre and is very active in all international manifestations, like \"The day without cars\", \"The day of healthy food\", \"Challenge day\". We are well known for our Art club which won numerous international prizes.\r\n\r\nGreen School Garden, In our school there is the active Eco-patrol consisting of students from the 1st to the 8th grade who clean the schoolyard after the main break every school day. Our school also organises a general cleaning action a few times a year that includes not only the cleaning of the school premises and the schoolyard but also the surrounding grounds.\r\nEach generation of students who enrol this school plants a tree in the schoolyard and also takes care of it until they leave school. We also take part in many humanitarian actions, like collecting second hand clothes and footwear for people in need, and books and other things for school for our schoolchildren who cannot afford buying them.\r\nWe also collect money donations for those who suffer from dystrophia and for the Red Cross organization and we organize performances for our senior citizens,\r\nOur students are also successful in sports like football, basketball and volleyball and in competitions in many other subjects like physics, history, geography and English language.\r\nThe pedagogue and the psychologist are the authors of two projects carried out at our school. One of them is connected to tolerance; it is the acceptance of Gipsies into our community carried out through workshops.\r\nThe other project is about non-violent communication among students and the activities of the \"Cool head\" club created for aggressive students.\r\nWe are doing our best to educate our students well and to be the leading school in that in our town and in wider community.\r\n \r\nWe started the Life-link activities 2005, mostly carried out at English clubs in 2005 and the first bigger project was \"The culture of peace in our school\" with the competition in essay writing and in photography display.\r\nIn December, the same year we had a Week of tolerance carried out through workshops. In April 2006 there was the action \"Open door\" when our future 1st grade students and their parents visited our school. From the 11th of May to the 1st of June 2006, we took part in the campaign \"Clean up the World” WITH PROJECTS ABOUT OUR PLANET AND THE DANGERS OF HUMAN NEGLIGENCE. In November 2006 we organized the \"Children\'s week\" at our school, with fun-activities and no testing at classes during that week. In December 2006 we sent a report on the excursion to Belgrade for our best students, where they visited the Tesla Museum. We also sent reports on the \"Cool head\" club in May 2007, on the \"Family day\" when children drew pictures of their families on the asphalt in the schoolyard and on the main square in town centre in June and on the \"Environmental Day\" also in June 2007.\r\n\r\n',673,'7-15',52,0,'','','NULL','2007-07-25 00:00:00','2007-07-28 00:00:00','');

Then I talked briefly about the seriousness of the problem of child abuse.\r\nOn the 21st of October, the last lecture was held in our school lecture hall. In the presence of our deputy principle, our social worker talked to groups of students from every age about children rights, child abuse and labor through a small slideshow of pictures.

REPLACE INTO "member_reports" VALUES (4268,449,'2008-03-06',3,'Introduction:\r\nHave you given yourself some time to look back in time, to long ago… when our Earth was first created? What has kept plants, animals the first generations of human beings alive… to give birth to our era? The answer is very simple: water. Water, one of the four elements of our mother Earth, is the reason we are all here. The first great civilizations that emerged were alongside the Nile, the Tigris and Euphrates, the Indus and the Yangtze. A coincidence? I think not.\r\nWater for life:\r\nImagine life with deficiency in water. You’re walking on a really hot day, dying of thirst. You pass by a convenience store, already imagining that satisfying quench as the cold, clear liquid passes through your mouth, when you’re shocked as you glance at the price of the bottle. Later, you walk back to your home… only to find a huge water bill waiting at your front door. Unfortunately, this is forecasted to become real in the near future. Just take a walk in your neighborhood, you’ll find people soaking their plants, showering their cars, sterilizing their dogs. Here in Egypt, water is sprayed on the street seeking water vapor for mere refreshment! Not so far away in mid-Africa, people are dying from thirst, surviving with only a few drops of water!\r\nOur role:\r\nThat’s where we jump in. We are doing what’s in our ability to raise people awareness to the importance of saving water. I started with a survey conducted with 6 random people in the street, it was about:\r\n·	Their usage of water\r\n·	Whether they actually care about saving water. What do they do to save water?\r\n·	Whether they ever thought about the water problem. If yes, in Egypt only, or internationally?\r\n·	What do they think should be done?\r\nA recorded video of my survey will be available and sent soon.\r\nOnce again, our role as life-link members was to raise the awareness of students in our school. Three different lectures were held by three different life-link school committee members.\r\nThe first lecture was on the 6th of March, given by Mahmoud El Enbaby from our group. It was given in front of two classes of young teenagers (almost 40), and a couple of interested parents. He gave an introduction to water mentioning very interesting scientific facts. He also talked about the value of water and its usage in our daily life, people’s attitude and reaction to water, the good and the bad. \r\nThe second lecture was on the 19th, given by Karim Nader Yakoot, another life-link school committee member. He talked about the various ways of saving and conserving water in our daily life. He also talked about the bad effects of people’s behavior on water including wastage and pollution.\r\n\r\nHabiba Shousha gave the last lecture on the 31st of March, where she talked about the importance of water to world peace, especially in Africa, where 9 countries including Egypt signed a treaty to share water from the Nile equally. She also mentioned the rights and duties of each country.\r\n',40,'14-20',0,5,'','','NULL','2008-05-10 00:00:00','2008-05-13 00:00:00','Regards! /HL');

Good morning and good evening to staffs at United Nation , ENO Schools and also to the participating school from United States of America , Canada , Australia , iEARN and our teachers and friends from Malaysia.\r\nWe are happy to present our project on TREE PLANTING.\r\nDue to some technical problem we could not go live on videoconference but we would be presenting on the phone and you may watch our powerpoint presentation.\r\nWe started with Cyber Plant Conservation Projects – CPCP in 2006 . The first school in our province to start and we are the number one in Malaysia. We planted 60 rare fruit trees in our school compound. The whole school is involve in this project. You may check at our website \r\nwww.cpcp.org.my \r\nLater our school River Rangers – the first one in Malaysia, Scouts , Nature Club Members and ENO Club were invited for a tree planting project at Kuala Gula, Perak , Malaysia by GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT CENTRE. We managed to plant 4000 mangroves in 2006. \r\nWhen the United Nation launched THE BILLION TREE CAMPAIGN in late 2006 , our school was the first to be involve and till today we have succeeded in planting 40 thousand seedlings in different sites around Malaysia with the help of District Education Office, Friends of Mangroves Kuala Gula and Global Environment Centre.\r\nWe set a target of 100,000 trees by end of 2007 as a gift for peace in celebrating Centenary Scouting and a million trees by end of 2008.\r\nOur school principal Mrs Nooriah Bahari and teacher Mr Kalaimani are the main force behind the scene with Mr Balu Perumal – Malaysian First Digi Amazing Man and Mr Mika Vanhanen of ENO Finland. They have put a lot of effort on this project and we would continue in our mission to promote tree planting activities worldwide. \r\nREDUCE CLIMATE CHANGE AND WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE.\r\nThe Tree Planting Project is a Partnership between our school, ENO Environment School (Finland), Global Environment Centre (GEC) , Scouts of Malaysia and Friends of Mangrove Forest.\r\n\r\nTree planting is important for us. Firstly, it reminds us of the nature and the importance of environmental protection. Secondly, it is a symbol for the international co-operation.\r\n\r\nThe mangrove seedlings were planted in a 10ha area in Telok Rubiah, which is the designated site for the mangrove rehabilitation project. More seedlings will be planted over a one-year period. GEC envisions that the rehabilitation of the degraded mangrove area through planting and increased protection will improve the surrounding mangrove habitat. \r\nOur school students have been spending weekend and school holidays planting mangrove seedlings and seeds to save on of the remaining mangrove sites along the west coast of Malaysia. Students help prepare nursery beds and transport seedlings to the planting site. It takes 40 of us to plant 1,000 seedlings and 500 seeds in 2 hours.\r\n\r\nThe long-term plan is to develop the area into a nature park / bird sanctuary managed by the local community. It was the first step towards rehabilitation .\r\n\r\nThe school plan to mobilise students nation-wide to plant one million trees and hopes that it can be achieved in the Kuala Gula area. Mangroves are the only defence against sea storms and tsunami and without them, coastal villages such as Kuala Gula will be left defenceless and at the mercy of nature. \r\nKuala Gula covers 6,870 ha and has been earmarked as a Ramsar Site (Wetlands of Global Importance). It is a small fishing village and an important eco-tourism site, renowned as an important migratory bird research and observation site. However, over recent years, the mangroves along the coastline have been degraded. Following the tsunami in 2004, there has been an urgent need to address the lack of mangrove protection. \r\n\r\nWhat are mangroves ?\r\nThe term mangroves refer to plants that grow in salty or saline water in the intertidal and coastal zone. Mangroves grow better in protected estuaries as very few species are able to grow in this environment.\r\nWhy are mangroves important ?\r\nFirst -	Food products \r\nMangroves are important breeding ground for our fishes , prawns , crabs and crustaceans , which are our major source of food.\r\n\r\nSecond - Other forest products\r\nTrees from mangroves can be used for timber , construction material , firewood and charcoal. Mangroves also produce non-timber products such as herbs , which contain medicinal value .\r\nThird - Protection from erosian , wind and waves\r\nMangroves act as a windbreaker against strong wind and waves , thus providing natural coastline protection. Mangroves also prevent erosion.\r\nFourth - Nutrient and sediment retention\r\nMangroves act as sinks for nutrients and sediments as its vegetation can absorb them. The nutrients remain in the mangrove where it will support other organisma growth\r\nFifth - Education and Research\r\nMangroves support a diversity of wildlife of which many are endemic or threatened and rich vegetation , some of which has great medicinal values and are yet to be discovered.\r\n\r\nFlora\r\nIt is not easy to survive in the mangrove environment and many species have developed adaptations to overcome them .\r\n\r\nFauna\r\nOur tree planting area , Kuala Gula harbors a large variety of wildlife species – insects ( fireflies ) , cructaceans , mammals , reptiles , resident and migratory birds ranging to 150.\r\n\r\nENO Programme invites to an exciting event. ENO Tree Planting Day 2008 will be organised on the 22nd of September, the day of autumnal equinox. Trees would be planted at midday, in every corner of the world. The first trees will be planted at midday in Oceania. Following the Sun, new trees will be put to earth in Asia, Europe and Africa. Finally this chain of trees will reach America. This event will be held in 100 countries with 1000 schools participating around the day.\r\n\r\nYear 2011 will be an International Year of Forests. Tree planting actions at schools and amongst children and youth could be done with the help of United Nation.\r\n\r\nYour contribution is important! Your trees will be part of ENO 100 Billion Tree Planting Campaign under the United Nations Billion Tree Campaign.This tree planting campaign will no doubt contribute a great deal to reducing greenhouse gases.\r\n\r\nPlease support our online petition for Tree Planting at\r\n\r\nwww.ipetitions.com/petition/100billion \r\n\r\nWE NEED YOUR SUPPORT\r\nPLANT MORE TREES\r\nREDUCE CLIMATE CHANGE\r\nAND WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE\r\n\r\nA million thanks to United Nation and ENO for making this presentation a successful one.

Sri Lanka has a Buddhist culture. According to the Buddhist culture they highly respect trees. At present everywhere in Sri Lanka people worship to Bo trees. When I examine this culture , I understood there were 28 Buddhas who got their Englightment (Buddhaship) under the various trees. That means people respect these trees.\r\nThen I met Hon. Patali Champika Ranawaka - Minister of Environment and explain our ENO tree planting day on 22nd September. We wanted to explain our students value of tree planting. Planting the \"ATAVISI BODHI RUKSHA\" the trees used by past Buddhas is most successful way to launch this valuable project.\r\nAfter Hon. Minister promised me to provide these vary valuable and rare set of \"ATAVISI BODI RUKSHA\" plants.\r\nLast 30th August early morning we left from Colombo with these tree plants to Mahiyangana - a historic ancient city. Over 500 children,teachers and parents travelled by a vehicle prossession.\r\nWe had our lunch at historic city of Kandy. We opened a chidren\'s library at Hunnasgiriya Mountain town. In the evening we reached to Mahiyanganaya.\r\nStudents attended cultural activities and it was a great joyful movement to all participants. \r\nNext morning they start to plant trees. As this is a very special moment all media covered this event. ITN national television service made a special with us about this programe.\r\nAt the TV interview I stated, \"At present tree planting is a need to protect human lives. Buddha has stated the value of tree planting. Not only that. Over 28 Buddhas stated the value of tree planting. Now Sri Lankan can give this valuable message to the world. Therefore we plant 28 bo trees today to commence World Tree planting day on 22 September, 2008.\".\r\nThank you,\r\nYours sincerely, \r\nD.Ambalampitiya.',500,'',0,0,'','','NULL','2008-10-13 00:00:00','2008-10-16 00:00:00','Congratulations! /HL');

How do we know it is safe to drink? To answer these questions, it\'s important to go back to the basics. There are two main sources of water: surface water and groundwater. Surface Water is found in lakes, rivers, and reservoirs. Groundwater lies under the surface of the land, where it travels through and fills openings in the rocks. The rocks that store and transmit groundwater are called aquifers. Groundwater must be pumped from an aquifer to the earth\'s surface for use. \rConsumers receive their water from one of two sources: a private well, or a community water system.

In the United States, the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) sets strict standards for approximately 90 different types of contaminants that can be found in drinking water. we have compiled a list of the most common water pollutants and categorized them below to provide you with detailed information on specific contaminants and their effects on your health.\rMicrobes\r\rFecal Coliform and E coli are bacteria whose presence indicate that the water may be contaminated with human or animal wastes. Microbes in these wastes can cause short-term effects, such as diarrhea, cramps, nausea, headaches, or other symptoms. \r\rCryptosporidium is a parasite that enters lakes and rivers through sewage and animal waste. This microbe has an outer shell that allows it to survive outside the body for long periods of time which makes it tolerant to many chlorine disinfectants. It causes cryptosporidiosis, a mild gastrointestinal disease. However, the disease can be severe or fatal for people with severely weakened immune systems. EPA and CDC have prepared advice for those with severely compromised immune systems who are concerned about Cryptosporidium. \r\rGiardia lamblia is a parasite that enters lakes and rivers through sewage and animal waste. It causes gastrointestinal illness (e.g. diarrhea, vomiting, cramps). Giardia, like cryptosporidium, can survive long periods of time outside the body and is also difficult to treat with just basic chlorine disinfectants.\r\rColiform bacteria are common in the environment and are generally not harmful. However, the presence of these bacteria in drinking water is usually a result of a problem with the treatment system or the pipes which distribute water. This indicates that the water may be contaminated with germs that can cause disease.\r\rTurbidity has no health effects. However, turbidity can interfere with disinfection because the particles can act as shields for viruses and bacteria and provide a medium for microbial growth. Turbidity may indicate the presence of disease causing organisms. These organisms include bacteria, viruses, and parasites that can cause symptoms such as nausea, cramps, diarrhea, and associated headaches.',15,'13-15',8,30,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2012-02-10 21:46:00','2013-04-20 13:00:00','Regards! /Roula');

The oxygen atom also called the \"apex of the water molecule\" bears a slight electronegative charge while hydrogen possesses a more positive one (Kirk 225). Because of the opposite charges attract, the water molecules are drawn together. When an oxygen atom is linked to a molecule\'s hydrogen atom, a bond called a hydrogen bond is formed (Kirk 256). There are several types of water molecule such as liquid water, ice and water vapor. These are all as important as we need in our daily lives.
