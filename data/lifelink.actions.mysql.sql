Life-Link, on it\'s website, will continously add the reported actions under each of the school names.\r\n\r\nEach participating school sets up an E-mail address and advertises the use of it. Schools who do not have the Internet could contact a local enterprise or government or Rotary club or the Mayor etc, asking for a small favour to use their IT services. This will create an interest of the nearby community for the campaign Youth Peace Actions 2000+.\r\n\r\nSchools addresses will on demand be available on the Life-Link website.
