We understand the importance of entering international networking and campaign. Taking into consideration the calls for innovative approaches we\'ve made up our mind and came to a decision to introduce the Water for Life and Culture of Care programs to our school regular curriculum. We have 1 lesson in a week called form meeting. Within this hour students discuss urgent affairs of the class, hold debates on the topics bothering them. Our administration gave us a chance to introduce 10 minutes briefings into the duration of the form meeting. The group of students, involved in the Life Link Leaf program of our school is in the process of performing presentations of the Life Link programs and actions. Thus we\'ll manage to increase the quantity of students participating in the Earth Care Campaign 2010-2014. We\'ll do our best to awake students\' concern in the global value topics.\r\nBest regards,\r\nNadezhda Pushkareva\r\nLife Link coordinator Moscow school 1411. January 2011',NULL);
